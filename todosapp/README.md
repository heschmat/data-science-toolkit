# Build a CRUD App with SQLAlchemy

In summary, here are the skills we'll master as we build out the todo-application:

- Traversing across all layers of backend stack, from backend server in Flask to database in Postgres, by understanding mappings between user operations, to the ORM, to the SQL executed on a database.
- Developing using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, for architecting out our application.
- Handling changes to our data schema over time.
- Modeling relationships between objects in our web application.
- Implementing Search.
