#The fundamentals of back-end web development!

## Summary:
Create a data-driven web application that queries a database for items on restaurant menus and then dynamically generates complete menus in the form of web pages and API endpoints.

## Objectives:
- how to interact with a database from a web application using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer
- how GET and POST requests translate to CRUD operations
- the Flask framework fundamentals and the various ways in which it can speed up the development of applications
- develop a web application from the ground up using the iterative development process



## Instructions:
1. `python database_setup.py` creates the database `restaurantmenu.db`
2. `python restaurants_and_menus.py` populates the database tables. To see an overview of what's inside checkout `database_analysis.ipynb`
